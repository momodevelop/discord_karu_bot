# Discord Karu Bot

*NOTE: This project is completed and is no longer maintained because Splatoon 3 is out and because Discord no longer allow my cheap bots to listen to messages in channels. Feel free to reference the code and perhaps build a bot that will be popular enough for Discord to allow that feature for you :)*

A simple Discord Bot written in nodeJS that will tell you the current map 
rotations of the Nintendo game Splatoon 2.

# Features
* Able to show schedules of Normal, Ranked and League and its map rotations.
* Able to show schedules based on time in the next 24 hours.
* Able to suggest a random weapon to use.
* Tries to capture human language, instead of being command based
    * e.g. Karu, what's on league at 2pm?
    * e.g. When is the next Tower Control League?
    * e.g. Karu, gimme a random weapon!
